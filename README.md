# NYC-Citibike-Analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

Work with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company and convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 

Create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 

### Resources
- Sofware: Tableau Public, Jupyter Notebook
- Languages: Python

### Summary:
- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format 
- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results:

- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas and Datetime libraries.
